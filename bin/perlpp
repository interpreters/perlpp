=head1 NAME

perlpp - Perl preprocessor: process Perl code within any text file

=head1 USAGE

	perlpp [options] [--] [filename]

If no [filename] is given, input will be read from stdin.

Run C<perlpp --help> for a quick reference, or C<perlpp --man> for full docs.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -o, --output B<filename>

Output to B<filename> instead of STDOUT.

=item -D, --define B<name>[=B<value>]

In the generated script, set C<< $D{B<name>} >> to B<value>.
The hash C<%D> always exists, but is empty if no B<-D> options are
given on the command line.

The B<name> will also be replaced with the B<value> in the text of the file.
If B<value> cannot be evaluated, no substitution is made for B<name>.

If you omit the B<< =value >>, the value will be the constant C<true>
(see L<"The generated script"|/"THE GENERATED SCRIPT">, below), and no text substitution
will be performed.

This also saves the value, or C<undef>, in the generation-time hash
C<< %Text::PerlPP::Defs >>.  This can be used, e.g., to select include
filenames depending on B<-D> arguments.

See L<"Definitions"|/"DEFINITIONS">, below, for more information.

=item -e, --eval B<statement>

Evaluate the B<statement> before any other Perl code in the generated
script.

=item -E, --debug (or -d for backwards compatibility)

Don't evaluate Perl code, just write the generated code to STDOUT.
By analogy with the C<-E> option of gcc.

=item --Elines

In case of an error in the input, perlpp normally tries to report a
file and line number close to the location of the error in the source file.
However, the match isn't always perfect.  If C<--Elines> is given, errors will
be reported at the line number in the generated script.  The generated
script will still include C<## sync> markers showing you about where the input
files/lines are, for ease of reference.

=item -k, --keep-going

Normally, errors in a C<!command> sequence will terminate further
processing.  If B<-k> is given, an error message will be printed to stderr,
but the script will keep running.

=item -s, --set B<name>[=B<value>]

As B<-D>, but:

=over

=item *

Does not substitute text in the body of the document;

=item *

Saves into C<< %Text::PerlPP::Sets >> at generation time; and

=item *

Saves into C<< %S >> in the generated script.

=back

=item --man

Full documentation, viewed in your default pager if configured.

=item -h, --help

Usage help, printed to STDOUT.

=item -?, --usage

Shows just the usage summary

=item --version

Show the version number of perlpp

=back

=head1 DEFINITIONS

B<-D> and B<-s> items may be evaluated in any order ---
do not rely on left-to-right
evaluation in the order given on the command line.

If your shell strips quotes, you may need to escape them: B<value> must
be a valid Perl expression.  So, under bash, this works:

	perlpp -D name=\"Hello, world!\"

The backslashes (C<\"> instead of C<">) are required to prevent bash
from removing the double-quotes.  Alternatively, this works:

	perlpp -D 'name="Hello, World"'

with the whole argument to B<-D> in single quotes.

Also note that the space after B<-D> is optional, so

	perlpp -Dfoo
	perlpp -Dbar=42

both work.

=head1 INPUT FORMAT

All text from the input is passed literally to the output unless enclosed
in the delimiters C<< <? >> and C<< ?> >>.  This is similar to PHP's rule.
The first character after the opening delimiter selects one of the modes,
and defines the content between the delimiters.

PerlPP first generates a script based on the input ("generation time"), then
evaluates that script ("eval time") to produce the output.  All Perl code is
run when the script is evaluated, except for commands notes as occuring at
generation time.

For double-quotes adjacent to the delimiters, add whitespace between
the quote and the delimiter.  For example, use C<< <? " >> and C<< " ?> >>
instead of C<< <?" >> and C<< "?> >>.  The exception is if you want to invoke
L<capturing|"Capturing">, described below.

=head2 Modes

=over

=item Code mode: C<< <? arbitrary Perl code ?> >>

The content is whatever Perl code you want.  It will be executed
at evaluation time.  It is up to you to make sure things are properly
nested.

=item Echo mode: C<< <?= Perl expression ?> >>

C<< <?= expr ?> >> is shorthand for C<< <? print expr ; ?> >>.

=item Code mode with newline: C<< <?/ arbitrary Perl code ?> >>

The same as C<< <? ?> >>, but sticks a C<print "\n";> in front of the code
you provide.

=item Comment mode: C<< <?# arbitrary text not including '?>' ?> >>

Everything in a comment is ignored, suprisingly enough!

=item External mode: C<< <?! command [args...] ?> >>

Runs the given string using C<qx//>.  If the command fails (returns nonzero),
execution halts unless C<-k> was given.  The stdout of the command is
include with the rest of the output of the script.

=item Command mode: C<< <?:command_name [optional args] ?> >>

Runs a PerlPP command.

=back

=head2 PerlPP Commands

=over

=item C<< <?:include filename ?> >>

Include the contents of the file called C<filename> at generation time.
The included file is processed as if its contents occurred inline in the
calling file.

If the filename includes spaces, use double-quotes:

	<?:include "some long filename" ?>

Make sure to include the space after the closing double-quote.

=item C<< <?:prefix foo bar ?> >>

After the prefix command, if a word starts with C<foo>, change the C<foo>
to C<bar>.

=item C<< <?:macro some_perl_code ?> >>

Run C<some_perl_code> at the time of script generation.  Whatever output
the perl code produces will be included verbatim in the script output.
See L</README.md> for examples.

=item C preprocessor emulation

The following work similarly to the corresponding functions of the
C preprocessor: C<< <?:define NAME ?> >>, C<< <?:undef NAME ?> >>,
C<< <?:ifdef NAME ?> >>, C<< <?:ifndef NAME ?> >>, C<< <?:else ?> >>,
C<< <?:endif ?> >>, C<< <?:if NAME CONDITION ?> >>, and
C<< <?:elsif NAME CONDITION ?> >> (or C<elif> or C<elseif>).

=back

=head2 Capturing

Capturing permits you to express single-quoted strings without having to
quote and escape.  For example, C<< <? print "?>some $text "string"<?" ; ?> >>
outputs C<some $text "string"> literally, without substituting C<$text> and
without the need to escape the double-quotes.  That way you don't have to
express long blocks of text as Perl string literals.

Capturing can be used anywhere a Perl string expression is valid.

PerlPP commands can be nested within captured strings.  For example,
running the script

	<?= "!" . "?>foo<?= 42 ?><?" . "bar" ?>

will output C<!foo42bar>.  The C<42> is generated by the nested
C<< <?= 42 ?> >> expression.

=head1 THE GENERATED SCRIPT

The code you specify in the input file is in a Perl environment with the
following definitions in place:

	package PPP_foo;
	use 5.010001;
	use strict;
	use warnings;
	use constant { true => !!1, false => !!0 };

where B<foo> is the input filename, if any, transformed to only include
[A-Za-z0-9_].

This preamble requires Perl 5.10.1, which perlpp itself requires.
On the plus side, requring v5.10.1 gives you C<//>
(the defined-or operator) and the builtin C<say>.
The preamble also keeps you safe from some basic issues.
